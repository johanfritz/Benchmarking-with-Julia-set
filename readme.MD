##Benchmarking using the Julia set
The purpose is the assess the performance of some programming languages for computational programming.
The programms are run on my Dell XPS 13 laptop running Ubuntu 22.xx, and the mode is set to *performance*
#Background: the Julia set contains all compex numbers $z$ such that the recursive formula $z_{n+1}=z_n+c$ for a given complex number $c$.
#Python
